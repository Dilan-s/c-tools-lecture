A couple of silly little utilities that didn't fit anywhere else, forming
libutils.a:

csvsplit.c:	a simple Comma-Separated Values splitter,
		making a callback for each field value.

readline.c:	a simple "read the next line of input, not overflowing"
		routine.

Plus test program:

testcsv.c:	some tests of the csv splitter.

To compile:	make

To install in TOOLDIR:	make install
