- This is simply yet another copy of our intlist example, for testing proto

- having installed proto into your c-tools, and having added the
  vi macro into your ~/.exrc, proceed as follows:

- vi intlist.c

	- add a parameter to one of the functions, or add a new function, or
	  delete a function.

	- save the file (:w).

	- then switch to editing the .h file:
		(:e intlist.h, or I have this rigged up as a macro bound
		 to 'v')

	- sit the cursor on the top of the existing prototype block, or
	  a blank line where you want the prototype block to go.
	  (eg. search for extern via "/extern[return]")

  	- then press "[".

  	- The prototypes update instantly!

	- write it out (:w)

	- switch back to intlist.c (:e# or CTRL-^)

	- undo your change, or make another change, whatever.

	- save the file again (:w).

	- switch back to intlist.h again (:e# or CTRL-^)

  	- with the cursor sitting on the first prototype, press "[" again.

	- wow!
