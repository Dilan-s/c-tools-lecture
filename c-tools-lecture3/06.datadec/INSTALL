Building on Unices
------------------

1. Extract the datadec-1.3.tgz file, creating a datadec-1.3 directory

2. Compile datadec:

	cd datadec-1.3
	make

3. Install it (run this as root) into /usr/local/bin and /usr/share/man/man1:

	make install

4. check that datadec is now on your path, eg. rehash, which datadec

5. cd test; make; ./ctest


Notes on Packaging
------------------

An alternative to (3) is to package datadec up and install it via installing
the package.  There are many different packaging systems: over the years, we
have packaged datadec for Solaris, Redhat Linux and Debian/Ubuntu Linux, but
only the Debian/Ubuntu packaging is up to date.

- For Debian/Ubuntu/Debian-derived distros, the tarball includes the debian
  subdirectory, this should work, invoke "dpkg-buildpackage -tc -rfakeroot"
  as usual (on a machine with the debian packaging tools installed).

- Also in this directory is a (nontested) RPM .spec file, which may serve as
  a basis for you to build an RPM, via
	rpm -bb datadec.spec
  (but it almost certainly won't work out of the box).
