a collection of useful C utility data-types and modules, forming libADTs.a

hash:     string->void *
longhash: string->long  (for frequency hashes, bags etc)
set:      set(string)
longset:  set(long)
intlist:  list(int)
strlist:  list(string)	(char *, tricky storage considerations)
wordlist: list(fixed-length-strings)   (each up to MAXWORDLEN chars long)

plus numerous unit test programs..
